# image-label-generator
In this project, we will be building an image labels generator, using Amazon Rekognition

## Description
Built an intelligent image labeling application utilizing AWS Rekognition to automatically detect and tag objects, scenes, and activities in uploaded images. Integrated Rekognition‚Äôs computer vision capabilities to identify items (e.g., identifying a cat in a photo) and return accurate, descriptive labels. This project showcases practical use of cloud-based AI services for image analysis and metadata generation.

## Getting Started
### Steps to be performed
In the next few lessons, we'll be going through the following steps.
Creating an Amazon S3 Bucket
Uploading images to the S3 Bucket
Installing configuring the AWS Command line interface (CLI)
Importing libraries
Adding detect_labels function
Adding main function
Running your python file

## Services Used üõ†
Amazon S3: For storing the images in the process of generating labels.
Amazon Rekognition: To analyse images and generate image labels.
AWS CLI: Interacting with AWS services through command line interface(CLI).

## Estimated Time & Cost ‚öôÔ∏è
